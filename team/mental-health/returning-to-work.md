# Returning to work

Returning to work after any break can be difficult, but we want to provide extra support for returining to work after leave for mental health issues. These guidelines are here to help you, with the aim of making things as comfortable as possible.

### Schedule a call with your Buddy

One of the first things you should do when you're ready to come back to work is schedule a call with your Buddy, it's important to get a feel for whether or not you're really ready to come back to work or not â€” and what extra support you might need.

### Phased Return

Would phased return be a good option for you? There are a number of options available including x number of days a week or only working half days. Talking to your Buddy can help you find what's right for you.

### Support available through the company

We are working to find an occupational therapist to support us as a team. This doesn't replace any therapy or medical support you may have, they would simply understand your needs and help advise the company on how to support you.

This section will be updated when we have an occupational therapist in place. Until then please see the resources section for advice helplines, and the Mental Healf First Aid section for peer-support in the company.
