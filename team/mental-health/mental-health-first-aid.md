# Mental Health First Aid

### What is a Mental Health First Aid?

_Mental Health First Aid is a training program that teaches members of the public how to help a person developing a mental health problem \(including a substance use problem\), experiencing a worsening of an existing mental health problem or in a mental health crisis. Like traditional first aid, Mental Health First Aid does not teach people to treat or diagnose mental health or substance use conditions. Instead, the training teaches people how to offer initial support until appropriate professional help is received or until the crisis resolves._
