# Business Continuity Management

## Purpose

The purpose of this BCM plan is to ensure an efficient, effective and adaptable response in the event of an incident so that Convivio can:

* Respond quickly and effectively to a disruptive incident \(incident management\)
* Continue to deliver business critical activities during the time of the incident \(business continuity\)
* Return to a state of **business as usual** as soon as possible \(resume and recover\)

## Planned Remit

The following functions are covered within this plan:

* Project management and delivery
* Service management to provide support for live projects

## Plan Owner

Ownership and responsibility for the plan is assigned to the following individuals:

Steve Parks - CEO

These individuals are responsible for the continued maintenance and implementation of the plan.

## Communication and Availability of the Plan

This plan is available online in our Convivio cookbook. Keeping it here means it can be accessed from any device. In the event of an emergency it's readily available.

## Reviewing the Plan

We review the plan at least once per year, around June.

## Testing the Plan

It's important to continually test the plan to make sure it remains relevant and effective. We test the plan each June as a minumum.

## Activating the Plan

### Circumstances

In the event of an incident the plan will be activated. Considerable disruption to our business operations or a project will warrant one or more of the processes being triggered. Specific incidents include:

* The loss of critical systems or access to them
* Sudden loss of key staff or key skills
* Loss or theft of equipment
* Loss, or suspected loss, of data

### Responsibility for Activation

It's the responsibility of all staff and contractors to report an incident, or suspected incident. If we need to respond then any member of our Business Continuity Team \(BCT\) will take responsibility:

* Steve Parks
* Steve Hunton
* Joe Baker

## Process for Activation

### Incident Management

The purpose of the Incident Management Phase is to:

* Protect vital assets e.g. equipment, data, reputation, clients

The following actions will be taken to protect our assets:

* Whoever identifies the incident should record and report details of the incident

* The BCT team communicates the incident to other members of staff and customers as agreed in their next steps
