# Holidays and Sickness

We all receive a minimum of 25 days paid holiday each year in addition to the usual UK bank holidays.

As part of being 'free range', we're experimenting with holiday freedom. This means freedom to arrange your work and holiday in the best balance for you, your colleagues and your current client. It means not having any limits of how far in advance you must book holiday or how much holiday you can take. We're all grown ups, we can make sensible decisions. The requirement is to both not burn out, or go out of business. There's a sweet spot on the big gap between those that it is best for us to find ourselves.

However, 'unlimited' holiday experiments in other companies have been found to lead to a 'presenteeism' problem, where people feel guilty about taking holiday. Therefore we all need to watch out for this in others, and we're going to strongly encourage people not to take less than the 25 days holiday per year.

Before you book any holiday just make sure you talk it through with peers and that you apply common-sense thinking. If the time off doesn't affect your projects, sales or personal development then you're free to arrange whatever you like.

We'll be monitoring holiday more closely during this experiment, and holding regular retrospectives together - so that we all understand the impact, positive and negative, that holiday has on us and on the company.

## Requesting Holiday

Simple. Get a peer review for your holiday by posting a request in the "peer review" channel in Slack. We need to make sure your holiday fits in with projects and holiday already booked by the rest of the Convivio team. If working with a client or partner you also need to check it with them in case of clashes with other holiday or key milestones.

When your holiday has been peer reviewed *you* need to log it in:

* [Float](https://convivio.float.com/) - we'll plan projects around your holiday
* [Holiday and Sickness log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oxl-NhfdMHMG55sDu9YzKh0npYBQucZEshxbko97Ko0/edit#gid=0) - we keep track of your allowance and remaining holiday here

It's really bad form to not put holiday bookings in the right places and let colleagues know about it properly - it puts strain on other people. We must respect the time of others and not spring suprises on them.

## Reporting Sickness

We all get sick from time to time. All we ask is that you let us know as soon as possible so that we can keep projects, people and clients informed. 

On the first day of sickness contact SteveH and/or your project lead (if you have one) to let them know you're going to be off work. If it's unplanned sickness then keep us informed so we know whether or not to expect you back in the next day or next week. If it's planned sickness (hospital appointment etc) then let us know your likely sickness dates as soon as possible so we can plan around them.

We log sick days in our [Holiday and Sickness log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oxl-NhfdMHMG55sDu9YzKh0npYBQucZEshxbko97Ko0/edit#gid=0)
