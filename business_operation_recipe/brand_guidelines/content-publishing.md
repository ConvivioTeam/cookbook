# Content Publishing

We want to publish a lot of useful and interesting content relating to the work we do, good practice, and new learning.

## Types of Content

### Blog Posts

We publish articles on [our blog](https://blog.weareconvivio.com/) that we think would be of interest to a wide audience. Our blog is hosted on Medium, making it very easy to create new articles. Simply use your browser or the Medium app on your phone/tablet.

Write a clear and appealing headline, and it's best to have a striking header image too, which will be used on the summary pages as well. See below for some suggestions of where to find images.

### Cookbook Pages

Our primary audience for the Cookbook is the rest of our team, but we choose to make it open for transparency, and in case others find it useful. Therefore, write as if you're addressing a new colleague who has just started with us and needs to learn all this stuff, but doesn't know any of the inhouse jargon or jokes.

Think about structure and findability - what are pages going to be called, where will they be put in the menu structure?

### Presentations

We give presentations at conferences, camps, in webinars and at events we run. We want them to be engaging, so avoid the usual powerpoint mistakes of having lots of text on slides. Use striking images, or simple words, and then elaborate on them through what you're talking about. These days it can work well to have short video clips in slides too.

Our template keynote decks, and examples of presentations we've given, are [on our Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1KlC8f33FUyb3dSX0dzWUkxa0U).

## Adding Images To Content

It's important that we respect the copyright of others when using images in our articles, so we can't just do a Google Image search and use whatever we find. We need to source images responsibly. Here are some ideas:

### Our own photos

We have a company account on [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com), and you can find photos we've all posted of work activities, events and socials.

### Stock photos

Stock photos that we have already purchased are stored in a private album in our google photos account \(see above\). You can find new images at one of these sites:

* [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/) \(free\)
* [https://www.pexels.com/](https://www.pexels.com/) \(free\)
* [http://www.gratisography.com/](http://www.gratisography.com/) \(free\)
* [https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/](https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/)  \(free\)

* [https://www.shutterstock.com/](https://www.shutterstock.com/)  \(paid\)

### Diagrams

You can draw diagrams using OmniGraffle \(native app from the Mac app store\) or [Gliffy](https://www.gliffy.com/) \(web app\).

### Videos

We have an account at [https://www.videoblocks.com/](https://www.videoblocks.com/) allowing him to download stock video clips for our use. Ask SteveP if you need a hand with this.
