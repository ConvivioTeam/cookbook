# Fair Tax Policy

Convivio aims to be a responsible company that makes a positive contribution to society.

We benefit from public services through the education and healthcare our staff receive, the protections of our security and legal system, transport infrastructure, a business and legal framework that enables us to operate, and simply by being in a society where our staff and families have their basic needs met and so can focus on higher economic contributions - and much much more.

Therefore it is only right that we contribute back to society by paying a fair amount of tax.

We commit to:

* Ensuring our accounts reflect the economic reality of the transactions we undertake in the course of our trade.
* Fairly assessing and reporting our economic activity to the taxation authorities.
* Paying the appropriate amount of taxes in line with the letter and also the spirit of all tax laws that apply to our operations.
* Paying the correct tax in the right location, at the right time.
* Considering fair tax measures in procuring all products and services that we use.

We commit to NOT:

* Undertake specific transactions with the sole or main intent of securing tax advantages that would otherwise not be available to us based on the reality of our trading operations.
* Undertake transactions that would require notification to HM Revenue & Customs under the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes Regulations
* Participate in any arrangement to which it might be reasonably anticipated that the UK’s General Anti-Abuse Rule might apply.
* Carry out operations in places generally considered to be tax havens
* Where our clients or suppliers may have operations in places generally considered to be tax havens, we will not take advantage of those places to secure a tax advantage, and nor will we take advantage of the secrecy such jurisdictions provide for transactions recorded within them.

Our accounts will be prepared in compliance with this policy and will seek to provide all that information that authorities, including HM Revenue & Customs, might need to properly appraise our tax position.

Note that we have update our accounts since they were first published, in order to provide more details of our tax reconciliation calculations for extra transparency. We've also submitted the amended accounts to Companies House. No financial details were changed.

Our first financial year was 15 months long, as we had 3 months of setup and 12 trading months.

### Forecast

In June 2016, our forecast for the year was:

* Turnover: £312,000
* Profit/loss before tax: -£42,120

### Final results

The final results for the year ending 30 Sept 2017 were:

* Turnover: £365,425
* Profit/loss before tax: -£9,384
* Profit/loss after tax: +£3,045 \(see note about corporation tax and R&D tax credits below\)

So we did better than forecast.

### Payments to Directors

The director of the company was paid £62,885 over the 15 months of the trading year \(~£50k p.a. pro rated\).

### Taxation

#### Corporation tax

The company made a small loss before tax in its first year, and so the headline Corporation Tax rate for the period was 0%.

The Corporation Tax incurred by the company in this financial year was therefore calculated as:

| Research and development tax credit receivable | £12,619 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deferred taxation | \(£190\) |
| **Taxation on loss on normal activities - P&L account** | **£12,429** |

The deferred taxation has arisen due to a timing difference in the purchase of fixed assets, where the tax relief has been claimed in full in the year of purchase and not when depreciation has been charged to the profit and loss account. The depreciation policy is 20% straight line.

#### PAYE / NIC

The company paid £95,776.12 of PAYE/NIC to HMRC in this financial year, of which £34,789 was employer's contributions.

#### VAT

The company raised £42,749 of VAT on behalf of HMRC in this financial year. A substantial amount of work in our first year was for clients in the USA, so no VAT was chargeable.
