# Proposals

We use [PandaDoc](https://www.pandadoc.com/) to write and generate proposal documents during the sales process. You can login using your Convivio Google account.

The advantages of PandaDoc is that you can easily save and reuse snippets of text to drag into multiple proposals, and that you can have more control over the design of the document with custom CSS. The downside is that it's not very collaborative, and the cost-per-user it quite steep.
