# Our Purpose

We define the company in five layers, building up towards our purpose. Each layer supports the others:

* Values: The beliefs and behaviours that are important to us and won't change.
* Motivations: The things that will make us fulfilled in our work and are the reasons why we work.
* Focus: The three points that allow us to triangulate to our core focus.
* Ambition: What we aspire to achieve in the next 3 years, one an internal ambition and one an external ambition.
* Purpose: The single reason why our company exists.
