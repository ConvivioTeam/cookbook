# Holiday

We all need holidays. They're important to help us to relax, to keep a balance, find rest and enjoy life, and it's important that we don't let it go too long between holidays.

At Convivio we have an unlimited holiday policy. There are no limits to how much holiday you can take.

Our approach to holidays follows one of our core motivations, that Convivio exists to support us having a great life for ourselves and our families. Our holiday policy has a few guiding principles, shaped by the tension of two needs:

* We want to make sure that we are well rested and properly energised, and especially that we don't burn out.
* We don't want to go out of business.

There's a sweet spot in the big gap between those that it is best for us to find ourselves. It's important that we take enough holiday to recharge us for doing interesting, challenging and rewarding work that makes us proud and has an impact on the world. It's also important that we don't put the business or our colleagues under stress when we take holiday. It's all about the right balance.

Unlimited holiday policies in other companies sometimes lead to a 'presentee-ism' problem where people feel guilty about taking holiday, or to holiday not being properly counted and people losing out on unused holidays. We don't want that here at Convivio: we all need holidays. So, we try to watch out for this in others, and we strongly encourage people not to take less than the 25 days holiday per year. We have a traffic light tool to help us keep track of how long its been since each person had their last holiday and when we need to prompt them to book their next one.

There is also freedom to arrange your work and holiday in the best balance for you, your colleagues and your current client. We don't have any limits of how far in advance you must book holiday.

Before you book any holiday just make sure you talk it through with peers and that you apply common-sense thinking. If the time off doesn't affect your projects, sales or personal development then you're free to arrange whatever you like.

We have retrospectives to review our approach to holidays so that we all understand the impact, positive and negative, that holiday has on us and on the company.

## Requesting Holiday

Simple. Get a [peer review](../peer-reviews.md) for your holiday by posting a request in the **\#peer-review** channel in Slack. 

We need to make sure your holiday fits in with projects and holiday already booked by the rest of the Convivio team. If working with a client or partner you also need to check it with them in case of clashes with other holidays or key milestones.

When your holiday has been peer reviewed you need to log it in [Float](https://convivio.float.com/) â€” we'll plan projects around your holiday.

It's important to put holiday bookings in the right places and let colleagues know about it properly out of consideration for each other, and to be be careful not to put unnecessary strain on other people. We must respect the time of others and not spring surprises on them.
