# Sickness

## Reporting Sickness

We all get sick from time to time. All we ask is that you let us know as soon as possible so that we can keep projects, people and clients informed.

On the first day of sickness contact SteveP and/or your project lead \(if you have one\) to let them know you're going to be off work. Often a quick message in the Slack \#general channel is enough to let people know you're ill.

If it's unplanned sickness that lasts for several days then keep us informed so we know whether or not to expect you back in the next few days or next week.

If it's planned sickness \(hospital appointment etc\) then let us know your likely sickness dates as soon as possible so we can plan around them.

We log sick days in our [Holiday and Sickness log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oxl-NhfdMHMG55sDu9YzKh0npYBQucZEshxbko97Ko0/edit#gid=0).
