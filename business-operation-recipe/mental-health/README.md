# Mental Health

Here at Convivio we care about your mental health. We offer support in order to help reduce the stress and anxiety of mental health issues.

Often the hardest part of coming to terms with any problem is discussing it with colleagues and friends. If you do feel like talking to us as a team there are two places on Slack for this:

* \#general - often it's a good idea to just get things off your chest and this is a great way of sharing with the rest of the team.
* \#safe-room - for things more sensitive the safe room is an ideal place to chat, this is an invite only channel and only contains staff of Convivio.

Alternatively, you can talk to your buddy, or any colleague who you feel can you can open up to. We're all ready to support each other.

We also have trained Mental Health First Aiders in the company who can help. Please see [Mental Health First Aid](mental-health-first-aid.md) for more information.
