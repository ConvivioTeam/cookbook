# Our Clients

This is the way we identify prospects, approach them, engage them, inspire them, reassure them, and win their business to turn them into a new client.

First, we have [principles for building new client relationships](principles-for-building-new-client-relationships.md).

Then, the recipe we follow is:

1. [Researching](researching.md): We identify a client we might want to work with. We learn about the organisation, identify key contacts, research their market and strategy.
2. [Connecting](connecting.md): We connect with the main contact\(s\) at the potential client, and begin to build a relationship.
3. [Nurturing](nurturing.md): We nurture the relationship, building trust and understanding, and actual value, until there is a mutual wish to work together.
4. [Assessing](assessing.md): When a good contact presents a potential opportunity to work together, we review it to assess the 'fit'.
5. [Learning and Thinking](learning-and-thinking.md): Together we've identified a potential opportunity to collaborate, and here we seek to learn enough about it to create a sensible proposal. Then we think around the problems and best approaches.
6. [Proposing](proposing.md): We create a proposal document, presentation and anything else that helps the client to understand our proposed approach.
7. [Agreeing](agreeing.md): Together we agree a plan of action for the collaboration and capture this in a contract to support the relationship.
8. [Beginning](beginning.md): We provide a smooth transition to active delivery of the proposal.

To create this recipe, we've drawn on many [sources of inspiration](inspiration.md), and it can be worth going back to these roots to learn more.
