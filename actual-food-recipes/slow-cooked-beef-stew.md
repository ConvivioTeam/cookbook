# Slow Cooked Beef Stew

* 3 Beef stock cubes in 2 pints of water 
* 500g of stewing/casserole steak 
* 3 large potatoes 
* 1 Swede 
* 5-ish Carrots 
* 5-ish Ternips

Put it all in a slow cooker, set it on low in the morning, before serving thicken it up with gravy granules, serve with some nice bread or dumplings. This should make enough to have a few savings left over to freeze.

Tip: The longer you cook at a lower heat the better but if your in a rush then you can set it on high and finish in around 4-5 hours.
