# Beginning

Once we have [agreed](/new_client_recipe/agreeing.md) to work together, and the way in which we will work, it's time to set up the relationship and prepare to go into delivery mode.

**Steps to Take**

1. Get Steve to send the welcome email, with the ['welcome to working with Convivio' email template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1evdI0tU1Z1GTsUzshyRHuRdGqpshCnv2AJUIzJAUhRY/edit), and the ['new client welcome pack'](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0adEBtk1YXvdnVJcTFqSzFOSGc/view) attached. \(or edit the email and send it from someone else if that's best for any reason\). Copy in the delivery manager for the project.

2. Check for the [response to the new client form](https://docs.google.com/a/convivio.team/forms/d/1dO67J1JqCtgvmqqAKMAqjqKJzCjae9Lu4ALJiiE7YGs/edit#response=ACYDBNg8kKoDVCgAwJUrLNAbuvW0ZF4QyQwzDFkJiIM0mS3sShbPqOzaDk3FNE8).

3. Enter these details into Contactually, our CRM, under the key contacts record.

4. Create a new client record in our accounting system, Xero \(if we haven't worked with the client before\) and add all the details for invoicing.

5. Setup a project folder on Google Drive:

   1. Open the[ '! Copy Active Clients Template Folder' spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DgBJEKN-RFmR5xSBtyeu1HTP2vJOgm1dNGWqljfTsMA/edit#gid=0)

   2. A menu will appear at the top 'GDrive: Copy Folder'![](/assets/! Copy Active Clients Template Folder - Google Sheets 2017-04-10 13-43-20.png)

   3. From this menu, select 'make a copy'

   4. This will take a minute or so to work and then you'll see a notification in the bottom right of the screen

   5. The copy folder will have been placed in the root of your Google Drive. Copy it back to the 'Active Clients' folder

   6. Rename it with the format 'YYYY-MM Clientname Projectname'

   7. There will now be a complete client project folder structure in place.

6. Within the project folder, under '10. Project Launch' folder, edit the 'Key people' spreadsheet with all the people that we know about who will be involved in this project.

7. Within the project folder, under '10. Project Launch' folder, edit the 'Project Brief' to use in briefing the team.

8. Within the project folder, under '10. Project Launch' folder, edit the 'Glossary' with all the terms we have learned in the procurement process.

9. Send a briefing to the project team, with a link to the Contactually record, and a link to the Google Drive project folder. Refer them to the project brief document.
