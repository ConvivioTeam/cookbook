# Technical Standards

There are many important aspects of the technical delivery of projects at Convivio. Most are best practices in the technology sector; some are particular to Convivio.

These fit into four main areas:

[**Code Quality**](../code-quality.md)**:** This is an umbrella for many best practices that focus on the quality of the product that is built.

[**Testing**](../testing.md)**:** Connected to the question of code quality is the principle and practice of testing the product.

[**Automation**](../automation/)**:** We automate as much as is reasonable, both in the way the product is built, and how it is tested and deployed.

[**Security**](../automation/security-standards.md)**:** We ensure the code, the data and the overall product are designed and built securely.
