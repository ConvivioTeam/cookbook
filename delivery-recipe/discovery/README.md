# Discovery

A discovery is the first part of a delivery stream.

It allows us to collaborate with the client to explore the mission that has been set for the stream.

A discovery is not a one-off thing. It's required to start a stream of work, but then key points of change or challenge may highlight the need for another discovery.

The process for discovery is:

1. Start with a [Discovery Briefing](discovery-briefing.md)
2. Do [Discovery Planning](discovery-planning.md) to decide which modules are required and how to deliver them
3. Deliver the required [Discovery Modules](discovery-modules.md)
4. Present the [Discovery Findings](discovery-findings.md)
5. Transition to a [Prototyping](../prototyping/) phase to test the findings
