# Help Card - Github

 We use 

[Github](https://github.com/)

 for managing the code of our projects.

Github isn't just a place to store code, though. It also has some handy tools for managing projects that often work well if the project is the right size.

## Issues

Each GitHub repo supports an Issues tool, where tasks, enhancemnets or bugs can be listed. Issues support comments for each issue, so team members can discuss what's at stake and make suggestions for how to resolve the issue.

For an example, you can check out the [issues on the Cookbook repo](https://github.com/ConvivioTeam/cookbook/issues).

There's a really helpful [guide for mastering issues written by GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

### Use labels

Labels are a great way to organize different types of issues. Issues can have as many labels as you want, and you can filter by one or many labels at once.

### Assigning issues

Normally, we prefer to allow team members to pick up issues themselves - having issues assigned to you can sometimes feel aggressive. In certain circumstances, though, tickets may get assigned to specific people.

### Closing issues

Issues get closed when:

1. a fix has been made to the files in the repository that addresses the issue
   * and that fix has been accepted.
2. it's not longer relevant for some reason.

We use the reviewing process of [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to inspect the fixes that are made. Pull requests tell your teammates about changes you've pushed to a repository and asks them to review those changes. Closing a pull request can also close issues.

## Projects

A recent tool added to GitHub repos is the Projects tool. This allows you to add notes \(and issues too\) to a Kanban board. Each project supports as many columns as you need and the column names are customisable as needed for each project board.

For an example, you can check out the [projects on the Cookbook repo](https://github.com/ConvivioTeam/cookbook/projects).
