# Prototyping Inception

The prototyping inception is an important period starting with a workshop, in which we gather vital information about a project, what work has already been undertaken and as a way to identify and communicate with key stakeholders especially if we are new to the project at this juncture. 

It offers an opportunity to gain buy in from the wider project team and ensure that everyone is focussed on the same objectives.
