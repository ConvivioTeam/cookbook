# Delivery Governance

Governance is about clear objectives, good communication, and supportive decision-making.

* [Steering Group](steering-group.md): A small group of stakeholders that meets regularly to support the delivery team.
* [Risk Management](risk-management/): A healthy approach to identifying, communicating and managing risks.
