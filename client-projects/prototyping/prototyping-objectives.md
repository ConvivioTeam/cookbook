# Prototyping Objectives

1. Validate/Invalidate discovery findings and hypotheses.
2. Test ideas for parts of the service with real users in the quickest and cheapest way possible, to learn rapidly. The aim is to increase knowledge and understanding of how to meet the user needs identified in discovery, not to build a thing. Expect things not to work, and to have to keep trying again until we find a way that does — or prove that it can't work as we'd want.
3. Test ways to build parts of the system in the quickest and cheapest way possible, to identify technical risk from unknowns/novelty. These prototypes should be disposable as they may not work frist time. Don't spend the time making things beautiful or best-practice — the aim is just to learn cheaply. Expect things not to work, and to have to keep trying again until we find a way that does — or prove that it can't work as we'd want.
4. Prepare the project for the build phase, or identify the need for more discovery, prototyping or even to stop the project.
