# Client Projects

This is the way we take client needs, investigate them, and work through all the stages of a delivery cycle.

We follow the process of:

1. [Delivery Team](delivery-team/): We assemble the right people to do the work into a multi-disciplinary team
2. [Delivery Launch](delivery-launch.md): Setting up systems, gathering information, ensuring everyone is briefed
3. [Strategy](digital-strategy.md): Working to develop the overall digital strategy for an organisation, and identify missions for streams of work
4. [Discovery](discovery/): Researching a mission and preparing for delivery
5. [Prototyping](prototyping/): Experimenting with complex, risky, novel or unknown parts of the planned delivery in a rapid and low-cost way to reduce the risks and improve knowledge and approaches before beginning the main delivery.
6. [Build](build/): Design, build, test, deploy to deliver a solution to address the mission
7. [Service Management](service-management.md): Supporting, reviewing and improving the live digital service
8. Retirement: Handing over control of the digital service, or eventually closing it down at the end of its life

To support this work we follow our [Digital Service Standards](digital-service-standards/) and practice good [Delivery Governance](delivery-governance/).
