# Sprint Retrospective

Regularly review what you do and encourage continuous improvement.

Sprint retrospectives are important and time should always be made for these meetings at the end of each sprint. The purpose of these meetings is to look at how the team managed the delivery during this sprint and look for ways to improve.

Although there are different ways to approach this, we essentially look at these four topics:

* What went well during the sprint?
* What didn’t go so well?
* What do we need to stop doing?
* What do we need to start doing?

This is simply a chance for the delivery team to sit down and talk openly about their performance as a team. If someone encountered problems during the sprint, don’t single them out. Agile is all about team work so if one person has a problem then the job of any good team is to figure out how to fix that, as a team.

If you meet regularly then you tackle problems as they arise and don’t give them the time to grow into something that affects the whole project. On the positive side you also identify what works well for the team and look to use that in all your future sprints.

At the end of the retrospective we record what’s been discussed and we review this in the next retrospective to understand the impact of any actions.
