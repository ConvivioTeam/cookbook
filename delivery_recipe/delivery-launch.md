# Delivery Launch

When we launch a new client process it's important that we start it right. We want to demonstrate the way the client can expect us to work for the whole life of the project by being extremely professional and very collaborative and transparent.

The process picks up from the '[Beginning](/new_client_recipe/beginning.md)' phase of the New Client Recipe. Once those steps are completed, we carry on here:

1. Organise a project launch meeting with the client team and our team. The main points of this are:
   1. Agree the aims of the project, and the contents of the project brief in '{project folder}/10. Project Launch'
   2. Identify any constraints
   3. Identify key team members and capture details in the 'key people' sheet in '{project folder}/10. Project Launch'
   4. Agree communications channels and project tools
   5. Map the stakeholders
   6. Map the risks
   7. Plan the schedule including key project dates and any team holidays or other known absences
   8. Agree next steps to begin work
2. Book out all the necessary dates for Convivio team members in [our Float Schedule](https://convivio.float.com/)
3. Set up communication channels / project tools that we and the client can all use. By default these will be:
   1. Slack for chat
   2. Github repository for code
   3. Jira for project management
   4. Google Drive for documents
4. Set up an email group for the project with the format 'project-{PROJECTNAME}@convivio.team'
5. Set the key people up on all these tools, and as members of that email group
6. Send the project launch email, from the template '{project folder}/10. Project Launch/Project Launch Details'
7. Post that same text in the slack channel and pin it to the channel
