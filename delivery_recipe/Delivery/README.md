# Build

In this phase of delivering the product, we take what has been learned in Discovery and Prototyping, and we begin to build the digital product itself:

* [Inputs to Build](//delivery_recipe/inputs_to_delivery.md): What we need to ensure is in place in order to start this phase.
* [Backlog Management](//delivery_recipe/backlogs_priorities.md): Gathering all the user needs, prioritising, and ensuring there is the right information.
* [Backlog Scouting](//delivery_recipe/backlog_scouting.md): Working ahead to ensure the 
* [Sprint Planning](//delivery_recipe/sprint_planning.md): Starting each sprint by taking the highest priority backlog items and planning how to deliver them.
* [Sprinting](//delivery_recipe/sprint-cycle/README.md): The day to day work in a build sprint.
* [Sprint Review](//delivery_recipe/sprint_review.md): At the end of the sprint, reporting on what was done and demonstrating the thing.
* [Sprint Retrospective](//delivery_recipe/sprint_retrospective.md): Learning from the sprint, and looking to improve the way we work.



During this process we also need to ensure good governance of the project

* [Steering Group](//delivery_recipe/Delivery/steering_group_meetings.md): A regular meeting of stakeholders to report on progress and take decisions to support the success of the product.
* [Risk Management](//delivery_recipe/risk_management.md): Success is based on clearly and regularly identifying risks, and then addressing them.



Our [delivery methodology](//delivery_recipe/other_methods.md) is built on the foundations of:

* [Scrum](//delivery_recipe/scrum.md)
* [Kanban](//delivery_recipe/kanban.md)
* [Lean](//delivery_recipe/lean.md)
