# Build

Our delivery process is designed to handle any and all types of change programmes. Rather than being tailored to a specific type of business or change, our processes focus on what’s important:

* Business goals - what is the business seeking to achieve?
* Users - who are your users and what are their real needs?

Once the scope is agreed and the initial discovery process is complete the high level requirements will be captured as epics. It’s here that the delivery team pick up the process.

## Build Kickoff

During this stage our teams will get to know each other and we’ll begin the process of diving into the detail of the requirements, discussing the possible approaches, how we’ll manage the risks and how we’ll exploit the opportunities. At the end of the kickoff we’ll have agreed the initial priority requirements that we’ll take into the first development cycle.

For more information about this stage see [Project Kickoff](/delivery_recipe/Delivery/kick_starting_a_project.md).

## Scrum - plan, do, check, repeat

Every two weeks your project will go through a process of planning, delivering and reviewing what’s been done. This scrum cycle is a fast paced cycle that is continually reviewing the priorities, delivering the highest priority stories and then reviewing what’s delivered. This cycle will concentrate on your users, how they interact and respond to what’s being developed and we’ll incorporate their feedback to make sure what we deliver will be accepted by them. No nasty surprises at the end of the development!

For more information about this stage see [Scrum](delivery_recipe/scrum.md).

## Quality - only the best will do

There are smaller cycles within the scrum cycle that deal with the quality of the work that the team produces. Those quality cycles check and prove the level of quality of the work to make sure it measures up to our high demands for quality.
