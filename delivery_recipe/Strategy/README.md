# Strategy

The aim of this phase of our work with a client is to:

* Understand the organisation culture, strategy and objectives
* Understand the value the organisation creates now, and the potential for new areas in the future
* Understand the current IT and digital approaches to supporting that
* Develop a picture of future potential
* Develop and prioritise outcomes to target with a programme of work towards the future potential
* Assess organisational capability, identify gaps and plan to address them
* Provide support to gain approval and commitment to deliver a programme of work
