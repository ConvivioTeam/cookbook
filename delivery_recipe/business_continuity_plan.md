# Business Continuity Plan

## Purpose

The purpose of this plan to to provide a flexible response so that Convivio can:

* Respond to a disruptive incident (incident management)
* Maintain delivery of critical activities during an incident (business continuity)
* Return to "business as usual" (resumption and recovery)

## Plan Remit

The following services and functions are covered by this plan:

* Project management and delivery
* Service management to provide support for live projects

## Plan Owner

The plan is owned by the following people:

* Steve Parks - CEO
* Steve Hunton - COO

These people are responsible for ensuring that the plan is maintained, exercised and updated in accordance with internal requirements for business continuity.

## Plan Distribution

The plan is made available online to all staff via our cookbook. It can be accessed from any device and access is not restricted. This makes it easy to access in the event of an emergency.

## Plan Review

The plan is reviewed annually (as a minimum). The next review date is planned for June 2017.

## Plan Testing

The plan is due to be tested before the next review in June 2017.

# Plan Activation

## Circumstances

The plan will be activated in response to an incident causing significant disruption to normal service delivery, particularly in the delivery of projects or access to data. Examples of circumstances triggering activation of this plan include:

* Loss of critical systems
* Sudden loss of key staff or skills
* Loss or theft of mobile devices (e.g. laptop, phone)
* Loss, including suspected loss or unauthorised access, of data

## Responsibility for Activation

A member of our Business Continuity Team (BCT) will activate and initiate this plan:

* Steve Parks, CEO
* Steve Hunton, COO
* Joe Baker, Lead Developer

# Incident Management

## Purpose of the Incident Management Phase

* Protect vital assets e.g. equipment, data, reputation, clients
* Ensure necessary communication takes place
* Support the Business Continuity phase
* Support the Recovery and Resumption phase

## Actions to Protect Vital Assets

The following actions will be taken to protect our vital assets:

1. Whoever identifies the incident should record and report details of the incident. If possible, email these to hello@weareconvivio.com
2. Inform members of the Business Continuity Team (see above)
3. The BCT assess the impact of the incident to agree response and next steps
4. The BCT team communicates the incident to other members of the team and customer as agreed in their next steps

## Communication Actions

In the event of an incident and this plan being initiated, the BCM team should be contacted. Other people within the team or within the client base may also be contacted depending on the details of the incident.

# Incident Scenarios

Following are a list of possible incident scenarios that could risk business continuity and the key steps to be taken in order to manage the risks.

## Loss or Theft of Mobile Device

* The member of staff reports details of the loss or theft to hello@weareconvivio.com or calls the main phone number 020 3875 3438
* The incident is reported to the support team
* Details are recorded in the [Incident Management Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZaHs2A5mMlN3m4aXX_lCGMBEYTMNAknwHPpsJzbCJDI/edit#gid=0)
* GitHub account is suspended
* Google account is suspended
* RingCentral account is suspended
* Xero account is suspended
* Slack account is suspended
* A location trace is attempted using Apple's Find My Phone
* Details are reported to the Police

## Loss of access to building
We operate as a 'free range' company meaning that our default state is that staff can work from anywhere. In the event of our office at the Gridiron not being available, or it being advisable not to congregate in the office (e.g.in the case of pandemic), this will not cause business disruption, even for extended periods.

## Loss of Critical Systems

Critical systems include any that affect our ability to do our jobs. These would include Google Drive, Slack, GitHub and internet connectivity. 

* Initial details are communicated to the BCM team
* The incident details are logged in the [Incident Management Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZaHs2A5mMlN3m4aXX_lCGMBEYTMNAknwHPpsJzbCJDI/edit#gid=0)
* Communication to all staff to advise of the incident
* Communication to the client if they're affected
* Assess key priorities for the remainder of the working day and take relevant action
* Publicise the interim arrangements for the delivery of critical activities
* Communicate resolution ETA when known
* Communicate resolution when systems returned
* Document details in the [Incident Management Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZaHs2A5mMlN3m4aXX_lCGMBEYTMNAknwHPpsJzbCJDI/edit#gid=0)

In the event that we experience loss of connectivity through a single internet service provider then we have the option to switch to alternative providers- home office wifi, public wifi, mobile phone techering. Only in the event of a national outage will we lose all connectivity. In that situation we will be unable to connect but the severity of such an outage would be dealt with as a priority by the network providers.

Key systems are provided by trusted suppliers. Data is backed up. The risk is that the functionality and communication within the tools is lost. Communication is key to business continuity and recovery.

## Sudden Loss of Key Staff or Skills

* Details communicated to the BCM team
* Details communicated to project team if necessary
* Impact and severity of incident is assessed
* Access to servers, applications is revoked where necessary
