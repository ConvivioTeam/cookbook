# Help Card: Github

<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/github-logo.png" alt="Github" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" ></a> We use Github for managing the code of our projects.

Github isn't just a place to store code, though. It also has some handy tools for managing projects that often work well if the project is the right size.
 
## Issues

Each GitHub repo supports an Issues tool, where tasks, enhancemnets or bugs can be listed.  Issues support comments for each issue, so team members can discuss what's at stake and make suggestions for how to resolve the issue.

For an example, you can check out the [issues on the Cookbook repo](https://github.com/ConvivioTeam/cookbook/issues).

There's a really helpful [guide for mastering issues written by GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

#### Use labels

Labels are a great way to organize different types of issues. Issues can have as many labels as you want, and you can filter by one or many labels at once.

## Projects

A recent tool added to GitHub repos is the Projects tool. This allows you to add notes (and issues too) to a Kanban board. Each project supports as many columns as you need and the column names are customisable as needed for each project board.

For an example, you can check out the [projects on the Cookbook repo](https://github.com/ConvivioTeam/cookbook/projects).
