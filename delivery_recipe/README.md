# Delivery Recipe

This is the way we take client needs, investigate them, and work through all the stages of a delivery cycle.

We follow the process of:

1. [Delivery Team](//delivery_recipe/delivery_team.md): We assemble the right people to do the work into a multi-disciplinary team

2. [Delivery Launch](//delivery_recipe/delivery-launch.md): Setting up systems, gathering information, ensuring everyone is briefed

3. [Strategy](/delivery_recipe/Strategy/README.md): Working to develop the overall digital strategy for an organisation, and identify missions for streams of work

4. [Discovery](/delivery_recipe/Discovery/README.md): Researching a mission and preparing for delivery

5. [Prototyping](/delivery_recipe/Prototyping/README.md): Experimenting with complex, risky, novel or unknown parts of the planned delivery in a rapid and low-cost way to reduce the risks and improve knowledge and approaches before beginning the main delivery.

6. [Build](/delivery_recipe/Delivery/README.md): Design, build, test, deploy to deliver a solution to address the mission

7. [Service Management](/delivery_recipe/service-management.md): Supporting, reviewing and improving the live digital service

8. Retirement: Handing over control of the digital service, or eventually closing it down at the end of its life



To support this work we follow our [Digital Service Standards](//delivery_recipe/digital_service_standards.md) and practice good [Delivery Governance](/delivery_recipe/delivery-governance.md).
