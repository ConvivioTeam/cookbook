# Quality Control in Sprints

If a job’s worth doing, it’s worth doing properly. If we’re going to create quality products then there’s a lot more to it than simply testing at the end of the sprint cycle. Here’s what goes into driving quality throughout our work.

## Coaching

Right from the start of a change programme we need to be making the right decisions, asking the right questions and prioritising correctly. Ultimately this is the job of the Product Owner but because it’s such a big job we provide coaching and support to help them focus on what’s important.

For many Product Owners, their time with us is also their first foray into Agile so there is a lot more going on for them to take in. We help them through that process, we provide the prompts, get them to prepare for meetings in advance, to have a clear picture of what they want to achieve and what’s most important.

The [Coach](/delivery_recipe/the_coach.md) adds value by keeping the Product Owner focused on what’s important.

## Prioritising Work

During the planning and pre-planning we discuss the work and the priority in which it should be approached. We look at what delivers the most value to the user, where the risks are, the effort involved and we prioritise on that basis. The team are then able to deliver the most value with the time and budget available, the client gets the most for their money and the users get the most from our effort.

## Discussing Detail

During the planning session we discuss the user stories in detail and then each member of the delivery team estimates the effort involved in each story. This approach means that the user stories are discussed in depth, that approaches to them are agreed and we reinforce that by estimating individually which quickly shows if there are differences in opinion about the complexity of the tasks.

This cycle of discussion and individual assessment, looking for a consensus, provides value by removing potential waste later in the sprint by not relying on assumptions about the requirements and approach. It also helps us to be more accurate in our estimates which in turn sets more accurate expectations of what is possible within the sprint.

## Peer Reviews

Nothing focuses the mind more than having your work checked by your peers. As our developers complete their work, each pull request is manually checked by another developer to check that the code is well written, that it meets the coding standards, that it’s efficient and that it’s the best way to implement what needs to be achieved.

## Testing

There are multiple ways in which we test what is developed including:

* Unit testing
* Automated tests (e.g. Behat)
* UAT

Unit testing is a testing step that checks the validity and quality of code before it leaves the developer’s local environment. This is a simple but important step.

Setting up behavioural tests that run automatically when code is deployed is a great way to very quickly check that the new functionality works correctly and that it doesn’t cause any regressions. Avoiding manual checks where possible is more efficient and effective and takes away the monotony from the team.

Manual testing through UAT is still just as important. We can’t expect to write automated tests for every possibility and we humans are great at finding those little errors and bugs that stop something working as it should.

The more testing nets we throw out, the more opportunities we have to catch the bugs before they make it to production. If we experience no bugs in production then we’ve hit our target.

## Iterative delivery

We deliver our work iteratively, in sprints, checking and reviewing at the end of each iteration. This cycle of plan, do, check, act means that we’re constantly looking at the effectiveness and the value of what’s being delivered. If a sprint delivers functionality that users give a bad review of, we’ve wasted very little and we can act on that feedback in the next sprint. If we were to deliver the project all at once it would be more difficult, more costly and have a bigger impact if we were to start making changes at the end.

When you deliver iteratively you deliver quality by making small changes based on user feedback, exploiting more opportunities to deliver what the user wants and what they’ll use which should be the focus of the changes.

## User interaction

Knowing that a product or service works is not as simple as following a process through to confirm that a form can be submitted or an order placed. To ensure the quality of what we deliver we interact with real users, those people who will be using what we build, whether they’re staff, applicants or customers.

There are various ways to interact with users including:

* Talking - ask them about the process, what worked and what didn't
* Observe - see how they interact, the paths they choose, how they discover
* Analytics - use metrics and funnels to watch your users navigating the process

Assuming what users need is no way to build quality into what you’re building. You need to listen to your users, understand what makes a good user experience and listen to the issues, those elements of the process that you need to improve upon.

## Retrospectives

How well did you perform in the last sprint? How accurate were your estimates? How many bugs were found in production? Quality control in sprints also includes how we deliver. At the end of each sprint we review our progress:

* how we delivered - how well are our processes working?
* what went well - what were the highlights? What do we need to start doing more of?
* what was bad - nobody is perfect. What was the lowlight of the sprint? What do we need to improve?
* what we’re good at - what have we been doing all along that we need to keep doing?

This is the opportunity to talk as a team about how we perform and to make changes that will improve the quality of what we do in the next sprint.

## Continuous Improvement

It’s important to continually look at ways to improve what we do and how we do it. When processes are implemented we can’t expect them to deliver every time. We need to analyse how we deliver our work and look to make changes, big or small, at every opportunity.

The tools we use and the approaches to meetings should be reviewed regularly too. An approach to sprint planning might work but are there alternative ways to approach the same thing, to keep things fresh and to relieve the monotony?

Continuous improvement is important to stop us from stagnating. We need to challenge our thoughts and assumptions about the way we work. Continuous improvement can be fun, rewarding and make a real difference to the quality of what we produce and the people involved in the process.
