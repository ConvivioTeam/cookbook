# Automation

We think of automation at several different levels, from the way a developer does their work to way we build and deploy applications. 

### Use better tools

We encourage our developers to use the most appropriate tools for their work. Modern integrated development environments (IDEs) – like PhpStorm or Netbeans for example – not only have excellent code hinting and code completion but will also sniff the code

### Task runners

E.g. Grunt, Gulp, etc

### Continuous integration

Continually build the development environment, run tests, return results

### Continuous deployment

Deploy to production often, automatically
