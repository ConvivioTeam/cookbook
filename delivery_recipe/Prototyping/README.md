# Prototyping

In the prototyping phase, we take what we've learned in Discovery and aim to deepen our learning of any parts of the project that are novel, risky or unknown.

We do this by building user-testable prototypes in a cheap and disposable way. That supports us trying multiple approaches to the same problem in order to find the best one.
