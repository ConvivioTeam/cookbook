## Be prepared

Prepare well for your meetings. If it’s the first time you’re meeting a client try to find out a little about them and the business. If you know some of the history, their current position and what they’re trying to achieve then you can add immediate value to the relationship by making informed suggestions. 

* What is the business?
* Who are the competitors?
* What do you know about the person or people you’re meeting?
* What do you know about the client requirements?
* Recent press articles?
* Statistics related to the client, their business, their products or services?

If you have ideas about a possible solution then talk to the team before the meeting to get a clear idea about what is technically possible, understand the challenges, the risks and how they could be managed or avoided. Being well informed and prepared will help your confidence and enable you to convey your ideas more clearly.

Once your relationship is established continue to be well prepared for meetings, whether they’re in person, on the phone or on a hangout. Understanding the current situation, the issues and the risks will maintain your position of control and help to maintain the confidence and trust of the customer.

## Relaxed but professional

We don’t strive to be another corporate behemoth. Our style is far more casual but professional. When you meet with a customer for the first or the hundredth time, be polite, courteous, ready to listen and confident in your suggestions and decisions. Approach the meeting as though you’re about to begin understanding and coaching a good friend. You’re equals in the relationship so don’t allow yourself to fall into a slave role.

Our customers will look to us for advice, coaching and guidance. We need to stay one step ahead, well informed, in control and able to offer solutions. If you don’t know the answers then take plenty of notes and agree a time that you’ll get back to the customer. You’re not going to have the answers every time but make sure to listen carefully and make the time to prepare a comprehensive, well considered response.

## Plan ahead

Before you meet with a client be sure to plan ahead. Make sure meeting rooms are set up correctly, that people have committed to the meetings and that you have everything you need to run the meeting.
