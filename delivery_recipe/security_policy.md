# Security Policy

Convivio's information comprises assets that require constant protection. The purpose of information security is to protect these assets from a range of threats in order to ensure service continuity, to maintain controlled access to those assets, to minimise the damage to Convivio and to maximise our performance for the well-being of all our stakeholders.

Our management supports the requirements defined by our information security management and it provides the means to safeguard our information using our Information Security Management System (ISMS) which is reviewed regularly for efficiency and effectiveness. Our security objectives include, but are not limited to:

* Preserving the confidentiality of information
* Making all information available when required
* Applying appropriate and effective security controls
* Ensuring compliance with legislative and contractual requirements
* Providing information security training to all staff
* Detecting viruses and malicious software
* Undertaking business continuity management, considering security, to protect Convivio against major failures and disasters
* Reporting and investigating all breaches of information security whether actual or suspected

While the Security Manager has responsibility for implementing the policy and providing  advice and guidance, all staff have a responsibility for its implementation.

This policy will be reviewed annually, as a minimum, or following a major change to the organisation.

##Overview

The CEO is ultimately responsible for the information security at Convivio, he is supported by the rest of the Convivio team.

Staff are all equally responsible for the security within the company. The following framework describes Convivio's expectations and how it will handle information and other digital assets and how it will apply security to maintain safety in an efficient and effective way.

##Principles

There are some principles common to every area of security:

* Our objective is to work transparently and openly to provide our customers with a secure and efficient service
* Regular risk assessments are carried out to identify any threats and vulnerabilities and to implement the necessary controls that help to prevent the risks to individuals, data and the general infrastructure. This will take into account the guidance from the Data Protection Act, Freedom of Information Act, the Official Secrets Act, Equality Act and the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act
* Our company culture is key in the construction of a secure environment and all security documents are available publically in this cookbook

## Governance
Our structure provides an excellent leadership structure to allow the provisions of a successful security strategy with the implementation of the following roles to support this:

* A Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO).
* Information Asset Owner (IAO).
* Other specialists relevant and specific to the organisation’s needs.

The non hierarchical structure of the business means that all members of the company including the CEO are actively involved in the quest to maintain digital security and observe any findings that can improve our security strategy.

##Culture and Awareness

Our open and involved company culture enthuses a security forward ethos supported by all users and employees of the company. A broad spectrum of technical knowledge across the team provides a wide source of security knowledge and threat avoidance techniques. We have a “one team” ideal whereby everyone is responsible for the company as a whole and we work in coordination to maintain the environment.

##Risk Management

We work directly with digital services which inherently attract risks which need to be assessed by the team to make information and business enhancing decisions. We have:

* A forward and informed understanding of the risks presented to the company
* An accessible and clear collection of policies and procedures are implemented to support good risk management techniques
* Well informed technical staff are involved in the analysis of threats, vulnerabilities and potential impacts associated with our activities

##Technology and Services

To comply with data protection laws and to remain resilient to cyber threats we will use the following implementations to make sure that security is integral to the development and deployment of services as part of usual working practises we will:

* Observe advances in technology and identify any vulnerabilities or issues that may be applicable to customers development environments and undertake any necessary steps to reduce possible risk
* Mitigate applicable threats
* Ensure security controls are current and actively managed
* Protect against, detect and correct malicious behaviour
* Ensure that critical technology and services are resilient to disruptive challenges such as cyber attacks, and have the means to recover from these
* Ensure access to data remains secure through the use of digital tools and access controls

### Personnel Security
Our employees are central to the maintenance of a good security structure and therefore the employment of these individuals is key to the safety of the company and its customers. To mitigate the issue of vulnerabilities caused by staff we will:

* Employ individuals using the Baseline Personnel Security Standard for anyone who has access to any government assets
* Put processes in place to evaluate levels of risk presented by an individual with appropriate levels of checks
* Provide regular security appraisals and nurture a security conscious working environment

### Physical Security
Physical security measures will also be used to provide a secure and unhindered working environment for staff that protects against a range of threats.

### Preparing for and Responding to Security Incidents
We have in place a structure that encourages the observation of any possible security vulnerabilities and also any incoming attacks. By way of reporting, evaluating and learning from any threats we can work towards preventing any future issues. To prepare for and to manage such incidents we ensure:

* Business continuity policies are in place that aim to maintain services and provide a resilient security arrangement to allow for a quick and effective recovery from any security breaches
* Regular risk assessments and reviews are in place to make sure that critical assets are protected
* All staff are made aware of the company policies for finding, reporting and responding to any incidents that may occur, all documentation is hosted online and all staff are required to be familiar with these. This includes any disciplinary measures that may be involved should there be a failure to comply with these procedures
* Reporting to the required government associations in light of any incidents if there is a serious loss of data or breach of security

## Policy Priorities
Our security policies work in a preventative way to protect information and all areas should be observed. However below is an outline of the priorities of these policies.

### Information Security

We handle a wide variety of information for a number of companies. Data may be generated, collected, processed, stored and exchanged. The above processes are done in a way that will;

* maintain security and confidentiality of the data
* provide a fast and effective delivery of service
* protection according to national security guidelines
