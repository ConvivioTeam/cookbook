# 2020 Results and Tax

On this page, we'll set out our financial information for the year for full transparency.

### Forecast

In October 2019, our forecast for the year to September 2020 was:

* Turnover: £952,700
* Profit: £103,770

### Final results

The final results for the year ending 30 Sept 2020 were:

* Turnover: £759,189
* Profit \(after tax\): £146,312

We had planned a period of rapid growth, but this was curtailed half way through the year by the pandemic, which added to the disruption in the public sector from Brexit. Sales turnover was therefore lower than forecast. But profit was higher than forecast because in January 2020, when [we saw a potential pandemic on the horizon](https://www.agencyradar.io/blog/planning-for/), we paused investment and growth plans and focused instead on building cash reserves.

### Payments to Directors

The director of the company was paid £54,692 in salary in this financial year, all through PAYE. This represented a multiple of 1.1 of the average salary in the company during the period. The director planned to take a reduced salary for the first 2 years of starting the company, but has extended this three times due to economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the pandemic.

### Research and Development Tax Credits

Given our work in the digital sector we undertake research and development projects for ourselves, and our clients. 

The government [incentivises and rewards R&D to foster innovation using a system of tax credits](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/corporation-tax-research-and-development-tax-relief-for-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises) managed by HMRC. Each year we submit a report on the projects we have done, the R&D elements of those, the staff time spent on them, and any resulting outputs. That report is then assessed and we are awarded a certain level of tax credit, which is calculated as a percentage of the staff time and other costs we have invested in the R&D.

The credit awarded is shown below in the computation for Corporation tax.

### Taxation

#### Corporation tax

The Corporation Tax incurred by the company in this financial year was calculated as:

| Tax charge and adjustment details | £ |
| :--- | :--- |
| Profit \(Loss\) before tax | 144,134 |
|  |  |
| **Corporation tax on profits at UK standard rate** | **27,835** |
| Capital allowances | \(1400\) |
| Expenses not deductible for tax purposes | 1,814 |
| Tax losses utilised | - |
| R&D Tax Credit | \(30,531\) |
| Deferred taxation | 554 |
| **Total tax charge for the period** | **\(2,178\)** |

The primary reason for the difference between the expected current tax charge and the actual current tax charge is Research and Development \(R&D\) tax relief. This relief supports companies that work on innovative projects in science and technology. Companies can claim enhanced expenditure for qualifying costs they incur on R&D projects, the deduction can be 230% of the qualifying cost or they can claim a tax credit if the company is making a loss, worth up 14.5% of the surrendered loss.

Other items that are affecting the current tax charge are:

* Expenses not deductible for tax - Some expenses incurred may be entirely appropriate charges for inclusion in its financial statements but are not allowed as a deduction against taxable income when calculating tax liability. E.g. Entertaining.
* Depreciation in excess/\(shortfall\) of capital allowances - The accounting treatment of capital assets differs from the tax treatment. For accounting purposes, an annual rate of depreciation is applied to capital assets and charged to the profit and loss account. For tax purposes, the depreciation charge is added back and instead, a tax capital allowance is claimed, a relief provided by law. Over time, however, these differences will equal one another.



#### PAYE / NIC

The company and our team paid £110,395.88 of PAYE/NIC to HMRC in this financial year.

#### VAT

The company raised £124,147.64 \(net\) of VAT on behalf of HMRC in this financial year.



Therefore, the overall contribution in UK taxes generated as a result of our business activities this year was £232,365.52.
