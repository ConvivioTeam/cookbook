# Environmental Policy

At Convivio we recognise that we all depend on the future wellbeing of the world and we are eager to play our part in averting climate breakdown. We conform with environmental regulations, laws and codes of best practice.

## Recycling and reducing waste.

The business is computer-driven. All our administrative and accountancy systems are digital, and paper usage is exceedingly rare. Communications with suppliers are by digital means whenever possible. Invoicing is entirely electronic.

All staff, whatever their role, use computers and internal company information is conveyed electronically.

We are committed to minimise printing. None are offered for home office equipment.

## Transport

We encourage staff to walk, cycle and use public transport whenever possible. More than 90% of our business journeys are made using public transport.

## Commitment

The whole business is fully committed to this environmental policy, which we regard as ongoing and which is reviewed annually.
